# ESP Sensors Project Improvement Tasks

This document contains a comprehensive list of improvement tasks for the ESP Sensors project. Each task is marked with a checkbox [ ] that can be checked off when completed.

## Architecture Improvements

1. [ ] Refactor the sensor class hierarchy
   - [ ] Standardize method implementations across sensor types (e.g., ensure all sensors override `read()`)
   - [ ] Consider using composition instead of multiple inheritance in DHT22Sensor
   - [ ] Create a clear interface for all sensor types to implement

2. [ ] Modularize the configuration system
   - [ ] Split config.py into smaller modules (e.g., config_core.py, config_sensors.py, config_mqtt.py)
   - [ ] Create a generic configuration retrieval function to reduce code duplication
   - [ ] Implement a configuration validation system

3. [ ] Improve MQTT implementation
   - [ ] Complete the MQTT configuration update feature
   - [ ] Consider using an existing MQTT library instead of custom implementation
   - [ ] Add support for MQTT QoS levels and retained messages
   - [ ] Implement proper MQTT message handling with callbacks

4. [ ] Enhance error handling and logging
   - [ ] Implement a centralized logging system
   - [ ] Add more detailed error messages and error codes
   - [ ] Create a mechanism to store error logs for later retrieval

5. [ ] Implement a proper plugin system
   - [ ] Allow dynamic loading of sensor types
   - [ ] Create a standardized way to register new sensor types
   - [ ] Support third-party sensor implementations

## Code-Level Improvements

6. [ ] Fix inconsistencies in sensor implementations
   - [ ] Ensure HumiditySensor overrides the `read()` method
   - [ ] Standardize method naming conventions across sensor types
   - [ ] Ensure consistent error handling in all sensor read methods

7. [ ] Improve type hints and documentation
   - [ ] Add complete type hints to all functions and methods
   - [ ] Ensure all classes and methods have proper docstrings
   - [ ] Add usage examples to docstrings

8. [ ] Enhance test coverage
   - [ ] Add unit tests for all sensor types
   - [ ] Create integration tests for MQTT functionality
   - [ ] Implement simulation-based tests for hardware components

9. [ ] Optimize memory usage
   - [ ] Review and optimize memory-intensive operations
   - [ ] Implement memory profiling in simulation mode
   - [ ] Add memory usage statistics to logs

10. [ ] Implement button-triggered display functionality
    - [ ] Complete the TODO in main.py for button-triggered display
    - [ ] Add debouncing for button presses
    - [ ] Support different display modes triggered by button presses

## Feature Enhancements

11. [ ] Add support for more sensor types
